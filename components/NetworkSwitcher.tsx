 * Which network the page in front of you is about.

 * and screen-reader-native, and it holds no state of its own — the selection
 * *is* the URL (see `lib/useNetwork.ts`), so the control cannot disagree with
 * the address bar about what is selected.
 *
 * Off the default network the control is deliberately coloured. A mainnet page
 * and a testnet page look identical otherwise, and "which chain is this hash
 * from" is not a question a reader should have to answer by inspecting the URL
 * they were sent.
